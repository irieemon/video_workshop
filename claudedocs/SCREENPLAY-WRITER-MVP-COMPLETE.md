## Known Issues / Limitations

### Current MVP Limitations

1. **No PDF Export**: Production breakdown and screenplay documents not yet exportable
2. **No Collaboration**: Single-user editing only
3. **No Templates**: Users start from scratch (future: pre-built structures)
4. **No Versioning**: No screenplay revision tracking
5. **Basic Validation**: Limited input validation on screenplay data

### Technical Debt

1. **No Testing**: Unit and integration tests not yet written
2. **No Loading States**: Some UI operations need better loading indicators
3. **No Optimistic Updates**: UI waits for server confirmation
4. **No Caching**: Episode/scene data fetched fresh each time
