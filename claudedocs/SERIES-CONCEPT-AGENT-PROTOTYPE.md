# Series Concept Agent - Working Prototype

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: ✅ **Functional Prototype Complete**

---

## Overview

A working prototype of the Series Concept Agent that transforms high-level series ideas into fully-populated database records through interactive AI dialogue.

### What It Does

From a single prompt like:
> "I want to create a sci-fi series about consciousness transfer"

The agent creates:
- ✅ Complete series metadata (logline, premise, themes)
- ✅ 3+ season arcs with detailed narratives
- ✅ 6+ characters with full dramatic profiles, visual fingerprints, and voice profiles
- ✅ 18+ episodes with titles, loglines, and plot summaries
- ✅ 4+ settings with detailed descriptions
- ✅ 5+ character relationships mapped
- ✅ ALL data persisted to database automatically

---

## Architecture Implemented

### Three-Phase Dialogue System

**Phase 1: Discovery** (2-3 exchanges)
- Gather genre, tone, themes, format
- Understand creator's vision and inspirations

**Phase 2: Expansion** (3-5 exchanges)
- Develop characters with personalities and arcs
- Create season-long narrative arcs
- Define key settings and visual world
- Establish thematic threads

**Phase 3: Refinement** (1-2 exchanges)
- Confirm details and resolve ambiguities
- Validate character arcs align with seasons
- Check relationships and conflicts

**Phase 4: Generation**
- Produce structured YAML output
- Validate schema and business rules
- Preview before persistence

---

## How To Use

### 1. Access the Concept Agent
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/series/concept`

### 2. Start Dialogue
The agent will greet you and ask about your series idea. Example conversation:

```
Agent: "Welcome! I'll help you create a comprehensive series concept.
        Tell me about your series idea - what genre, what's the core concept?"

User: "I want to create a cyberpunk detective series about AI consciousness"

Agent: "Fascinating concept! What tone are you aiming for?
        Hard sci-fi like Blade Runner, or more philosophical like Black Mirror?"

User: "More like Blade Runner meets True Detective - noir with deep themes"

Agent: "Excellent! Who is the main protagonist? Tell me about them."

User: "A detective who transfers consciousness to investigate crimes"

... [Agent continues building the concept through questions] ...

Agent: "I have enough to create your concept. Ready to generate the full structure?"

User: "Yes, generate it"
```

### 3. Generate Concept
Click the sparkle button (✨) to trigger structured generation.

The agent will produce a complete YAML structure with:
- Series overview (name, logline, premise, tone, themes)
- 3 seasons with episode breakdowns
- 6+ characters with full profiles
- 4+ settings
- 5+ relationships

### 4. Preview & Confirm
Review the generated concept in a tabbed interface:
- **Overview**: Premise, themes, format, tone
- **Seasons**: Season arcs and episode lists
- **Characters**: Full character profiles with dramatic arcs
- **Settings**: Key locations with descriptions

### 5. Create Series
Click "Create Series" to persist everything to the database.

Automatically populates:
- `series` table
- `episodes` table
- `series_characters` table
- `character_relationships` table
- `series_settings` table

Redirects to `/dashboard/series/{seriesId}` where you can immediately:
- Upload character images for visual consistency
- Start writing episodes with Screenplay Writer
- Generate videos from scenes

## Technical Details

### Streaming Implementation
- Uses Server-Sent Events for real-time agent responses
- OpenAI streaming API with `getModelForFeature('agent')`
- Progressive UI updates as agent types

### YAML Parsing
- Extracts structured YAML from LLM response using regex
- Parses with `js-yaml` library
- Validates against Zod schema

### Validation Layers
1. **Schema Validation**: Zod checks structure, types, required fields
2. **Business Rules**: Character name consistency, episode sequencing, protagonist requirement
3. **Database Constraints**: RLS policies, foreign keys, unique constraints

### Data Mapping

**Episodes**:
```typescript
// Flattened from season arcs
{
  series_id: seriesId,
  season_number: season.season_number,
  episode_number: ep.episode_number,
  title: ep.title,
  logline: ep.logline,
  structure_type: 'three_act',
  plots: { a_plot: ep.plot_summary, b_plot: '', c_plot: '' },
  metadata: { season_arc: season.arc, character_focus: ep.character_focus }
}
```

**Characters**:
```typescript
{
  series_id: seriesId,
  name: char.name,
  description: char.description,
  dramatic_profile: char.dramatic_profile, // JSONB
  visual_fingerprint: char.visual_fingerprint, // JSONB
  voice_profile: char.voice_profile, // JSONB
  sora_prompt_template: generateSoraPromptTemplate(char)
}
```

**Relationships**:
```typescript
{
  series_id: seriesId,
  character_a_id: characterMap.get(rel.character_a),
  character_b_id: characterMap.get(rel.character_b),
  relationship_type: rel.type, // ally/rival/family/romantic/mentor
  description: rel.description,
  metadata: { evolution: rel.evolution }
}
```

**Logline**: "In 2087, a consciousness detective uncovers a conspiracy where memories are being stolen and sold."

**Characters Created**:
- Nova Reyes (protagonist) - Consciousness detective, haunted by fragmented memories

- **Season 3**: The Collapse (8 episodes) - System-wide revelation and choice

**Settings Created**:
- Neo-Tokyo Transfer Clinic
- The Substrate (digital consciousness space)
- Kane's Memory Vault
- Nova's Safe House

**Relationships Mapped**:
- Nova ↔ Dr. Chen: Uneasy alliance with hidden connection

## Integration with Existing Features

### Screenplay Writer
Once series is created, navigate to series detail page where `EpisodeManager` allows:
- Creating detailed scene breakdowns for each episode
- Using Screenplay Agent to develop act structures
- Generating video prompts from scenes

### Character Consistency
Characters have visual_fingerprint and voice_profile populated:
- Upload character images to extract/refine visual cues
- Use character image analysis to maintain consistency
- Auto-generate Sora prompts with character templates

### Video Generation
Episodes → Scenes → Video prompts flow seamlessly:
- Episode structure provides narrative framework
- Scenes reference character relationships and settings
- Sora prompts include character consistency data
- Video generation maintains series visual style

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No inline editing**: Must refine through dialogue or manual DB edits
2. **Fixed structure**: Always generates 3+ seasons (could be configurable)
3. **No templates**: Can't start from genre archetypes (detective, heist, etc.)
4. **Single user**: No collaborative refinement yet

### Planned Enhancements (Phase 2+)
1. **Inline Preview Editing**: Edit character names, episode titles directly
2. **Template System**: Start from "Detective Series", "Sci-Fi Epic", etc.
3. **Specialized Sub-Agents**: Character specialist, arc architect, worldbuilding expert
4. **Collaborative Mode**: Multiple users refine concept together
5. **Export Formats**: PDF, Final Draft, JSON for external tools
6. **Regeneration**: "Regenerate Season 2 with darker tone"
