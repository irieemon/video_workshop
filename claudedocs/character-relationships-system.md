# Character Relationships System - Implementation Status

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Backend Complete, üîÑ Frontend Pending
**Priority**: Core feature for series continuity

---

## üéØ Overview

The Character Relationship System allows users to define and visualize relationships between characters in a video series, ensuring consistent character dynamics across all episodes. Relationships are automatically injected into AI prompts to maintain continuity.

### Key Features Implemented

‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Complete relationship tracking with support for symmetric/asymmetric relationships
‚úÖ **API Routes**: Full CRUD operations for relationship management
‚úÖ **TypeScript Types**: Comprehensive type definitions for frontend integration
‚úÖ **AI Integration**: Automatic relationship context injection in video prompt generation
‚è≥ **UI Components**: Pending (relationship manager, graph visualization)
‚è≥ **Tests**: Pending (unit and integration tests)

---

## üìä Architecture

### Design Decisions Summary

Based on systematic design decisions:

1. **Relationship Types**: Predefined list (friends, rivals, romantic, family, allies, enemies, mentor_student, custom)
   - Simple dropdown selection for MVP
   - Custom escape hatch for flexibility
   - Database supports future multi-attribute enhancement

2. **Directionality**: Both symmetric and asymmetric supported
   - `is_symmetric` boolean flag
   - Visualization adapts (undirected vs directed edges)

3. **Visualization**: Network graph primary, matrix secondary (future)
   - Phase 1: Interactive force-directed graph (MVP)
   - Phase 2: Relationship matrix for bulk editing
   - Phase 3: Timeline view for evolution tracking

4. **AI Integration**: Always active (automatic)
   - Relationships auto-injected into all video prompts in series
   - Zero user effort required
   - Ensures consistent character dynamics

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Table: `character_relationships`

```sql
CREATE TABLE character_relationships (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  series_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES series(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

  -- Characters involved
  character_a_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES series_characters(id),
  character_b_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES series_characters(id),

  -- Relationship properties
  relationship_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (relationship_type IN (
    'friends', 'rivals', 'romantic', 'family', 'allies', 'enemies', 'mentor_student', 'custom'
  )),
  custom_label TEXT, -- Only when type = 'custom'

  -- Directionality
  is_symmetric BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE, -- TRUE = ‚Üî, FALSE = ‚Üí

  -- Additional context
  description TEXT,
  intensity INTEGER CHECK (intensity BETWEEN 1 AND 10),

  -- Temporal tracking
  established_in_episode_id UUID REFERENCES videos(id),
  evolution_notes TEXT,

  -- Future enhancement
  attributes JSONB DEFAULT '{}', -- { familiarity, trust, affection, power_dynamic }

  -- Display
  display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,

  -- Metadata
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),

  -- Constraints
  CONSTRAINT no_self_relationship CHECK (character_a_id != character_b_id),
  CONSTRAINT relationship_unique UNIQUE(series_id, character_a_id, character_b_id)
);
```

### Helper Functions

**`get_character_relationships(character_id)`**: Returns all relationships for a character
**`get_series_relationships_context(series_id)`**: Returns formatted text for AI injection
**`relationship_exists(series_id, char_a, char_b)`**: Checks for duplicates

---

## üîå API Routes

### `GET /api/series/[seriesId]/relationships`
**Description**: List all character relationships in a series
**Returns**: Array of relationships with character details

```typescript
[
  {
    id: "uuid",
    series_id: "uuid",
    character_a_id: "uuid",
    character_b_id: "uuid",
    character_a: { id: "uuid", name: "Sarah Chen" },
    character_b: { id: "uuid", name: "Marcus Johnson" },
    relationship_type: "friends",
    is_symmetric: true,
    description: "Close friends since childhood",
    created_at: "2025-10-20T..."
  }
]
```

### `POST /api/series/[seriesId]/relationships`
**Description**: Create a new character relationship
**Body**:

```json
{
  "character_a_id": "uuid",
  "character_b_id": "uuid",
  "relationship_type": "friends",
  "custom_label": null,
  "is_symmetric": true,
  "description": "Optional description",
  "intensity": 8
}
```

**Validation**:
- Both character IDs required
- Characters must exist and belong to series
- No self-relationships
- No duplicate relationships (either direction)
- Custom label required when type = 'custom'

### `PATCH /api/series/[seriesId]/relationships/[relationshipId]`
**Description**: Update a relationship
**Body**: Any subset of relationship fields

### `DELETE /api/series/[seriesId]/relationships/[relationshipId]`
**Description**: Delete a relationship

## ü§ñ AI Integration

### How It Works

When creating a new video in a series with defined relationships:

1. **Fetch Relationships**: API retrieves all relationships for the series
2. **Build Context**: Relationships formatted as text:
   ```
   CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS SERIES:
   - Sarah ‚Üî Marcus: friends (Close friends since childhood)
   - Sarah ‚Üí Emma: rivals (Professional competition)
   - David ‚Üí Sarah: romantic (One-sided crush)

   IMPORTANT: When these characters interact, maintain consistency with established relationship dynamics.
   ```
3. **Inject into Prompts**: Context added to every AI agent's prompt
4. **Generate Video**: AI considers relationships when creating scenes

### Code Location

**File**: `lib/ai/agent-orchestrator.ts`
**Function**: `callAgent()` (lines 186-200)

### Example AI Prompt Injection

```typescript
// Before: Only character descriptions
CHARACTERS IN THIS SCENE:
- Sarah Chen: A confident software engineer...
- Marcus Johnson: A creative designer...

// After: Character descriptions + relationships
CHARACTERS IN THIS SCENE:
- Sarah Chen: A confident software engineer...
- Marcus Johnson: A creative designer...

CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS SERIES:
- Sarah ‚Üî Marcus: friends
- Sarah ‚Üí Emma: rivals

IMPORTANT: When these characters interact, maintain consistency with established relationship dynamics.
```

## üí° Usage Example

### Creating a Relationship

```typescript
// POST /api/series/{seriesId}/relationships
const response = await fetch(`/api/series/${seriesId}/relationships`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    character_a_id: 'sarah-uuid',
    character_b_id: 'marcus-uuid',
    relationship_type: 'friends',
    is_symmetric: true,
    description: 'Close friends who often collaborate on projects',
    intensity: 8
  })
});

const relationship = await response.json();
```

### Fetching Relationships

```typescript
// GET /api/series/{seriesId}/relationships
const response = await fetch(`/api/series/${seriesId}/relationships`);
const relationships = await response.json();
```

### Using with React Query

```typescript
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

function useSeriesRelationships(seriesId: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['relationships', seriesId],
    queryFn: () => fetch(`/api/series/${seriesId}/relationships`).then(r => r.json())
  });
}

function useCreateRelationship(seriesId: string) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (data: RelationshipCreateInput) =>
      fetch(`/api/series/${seriesId}/relationships`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
      }).then(r => r.json()),
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['relationships', seriesId] });
    }
  });
}
```

## üîí Security & Permissions

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

All relationship operations enforce user ownership through RLS policies:

```sql
-- Users can only view/edit relationships in their own series
CREATE POLICY "Users can view relationships in own series"
  ON character_relationships FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM series s
      JOIN projects p ON s.project_id = p.id
      WHERE s.id = character_relationships.series_id
      AND p.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### API Authentication

All routes verify:
1. User is authenticated (via Supabase auth)
2. Series belongs to user's project
3. Characters belong to the specified series
4. No duplicate relationships exist

---

## üêõ Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **No UI**: Backend complete, frontend components pending
2. **Basic Relationships**: Only simple type classification (Phase 1)
3. **No Temporal Changes**: Relationships don't evolve over time yet
4. **No Visualization**: Graph view not implemented

### Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Attribute System**: Add numeric scores for familiarity, trust, affection, power dynamics
2. **Relationship Evolution**: Track how relationships change across episodes
3. **Bulk Operations**: Matrix view for editing multiple relationships at once
4. **AI-Suggested Relationships**: Analyze character interactions to suggest relationships
5. **Relationship Templates**: Pre-configured dynamics for common archetypes
