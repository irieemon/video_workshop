---

## New Untracked Files Requiring Decision

### Documentation (Should Keep - Move to Git)
- Multiple session summaries and analysis docs in `claudedocs/`
- Implementation guides and troubleshooting docs
- Test reports and performance analysis

### Root-Level Docs (Should Review for Cleanup)
- `APPLY-FIX-TO-PRODUCTION.md`
- `COMPREHENSIVE-ERROR-ANALYSIS.md`
- `CRITICAL-DIAGNOSIS.md`
- `DECOUPLED_MODEL.md`
- `FINAL-SOLUTION.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

**Recommendation**: These appear to be working documents that may be duplicates or should be consolidated into `claudedocs/`.

### Scripts (Should Review)
- `check-db-state.js` - Database diagnostic script
- `run-column-type-fix.sh` - Migration helper script
- `server.log` - Server logs (should be in .gitignore)

**Recommendation**: Keep useful scripts, delete logs, update .gitignore.

### Migration Files (Should Keep)
- Multiple SQL migration files in `supabase-migrations/`
- Archive folder for old migrations
- Diagnostic queries

**Recommendation**: Organize migrations, archive old ones, keep active migrations.

---

## Technical Debt & Follow-Up Items

### Immediate Cleanup Needed
1. **Workspace Hygiene**:
   - Consolidate root-level markdown docs into `claudedocs/`
   - Add `server.log` to `.gitignore`
   - Review and organize migration files

2. **Git Status**:
   - 30+ modified files not committed
   - Multiple new feature directories untracked
   - Need feature branch strategy for this scope

3. **Testing**:
   - Verify all new features have test coverage
   - Run full test suite after cleanup
   - Update test documentation

### Code Quality
1. **TypeScript**: Verify all new files pass strict type checking
2. **Linting**: Run ESLint across modified files
3. **Performance**: Profile new streaming features under load

### Documentation
1. **Update ARCHITECTURE.md**: Reflect new systems (character consistency, streaming)
2. **Update PRD.md**: Document completed features
3. **Create Migration Guide**: For series decoupling changes

   git checkout -b feature/character-consistency-and-streaming
   ```

2. **Workspace Cleanup**: Consolidate docs, update .gitignore, organize files

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Run full test suite to verify integrations

### Important (Do Soon)
4. **Commit Strategy**: Break changes into logical commits:

   - Series decoupling and enhancements
   - Database optimizations
   - Voice integration fixes

5. **Documentation Updates**: Update main project docs with new features

6. **Code Review**: Self-review for quality, consistency, security

### Recommended (Do When Ready)
7. **Performance Testing**: Load test streaming features
8. **Migration Testing**: Verify database migrations in staging
9. **E2E Testing**: Add Playwright tests for new user flows
10. **Deployment Planning**: Prepare production deployment checklist

## Context for Next Session

### Quick Start
1. Review this session save document
2. Check git status and decide on branching strategy
3. Run test suite to verify current state
