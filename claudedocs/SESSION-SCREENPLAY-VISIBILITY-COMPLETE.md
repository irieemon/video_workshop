# Session Summary: Screenplay Visibility and Integration Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours
**Complexity**: High (multi-component integration across UI, API, and AI systems)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a complete screenplay visibility and integration system that addresses the critical issue of screenplay data being created but never accessible or utilized. The system now allows users to:

1. **View Screenplays**: Rich UI to display structured or unstructured screenplay content
2. **Use Screenplays in Video Creation**: Auto-load episode data when creating videos
3. **AI Context Integration**: Screenplay content flows to AI agents for informed prompt generation

---

## Problem Statement

**User Issue**: "When I'm working with the screenplay writer, I get so much more detail and then I can never access it again. I need to be able to see what the screenplay writer has created, and this data needs to be part of the prompt. We are losing the screenplay due to bad data practices."

**Root Causes**:
- Screenplay data stored in database but no UI to display it
- Video creation workflow didn't utilize existing screenplay data
- AI agent roundtable had no access to screenplay context

---

## Implementation Overview

### Files Created
1. `components/screenplay/screenplay-viewer.tsx` (242 lines)
   - Modal component for displaying screenplay content
   - Supports structured (scenes) and unstructured (text) formats
   - Expandable scene cards with dialogue, actions, characters

### Files Modified
1. `components/screenplay/episode-manager.tsx`
   - Added "View Screenplay" button with Eye icon
   - Integrated ScreenplayViewer modal
   - Fixed syntax error (missing closing bracket)

2. `components/screenplay/index.ts`
   - Exported ScreenplayViewer component

3. `components/videos/episode-selector.tsx`
   - Enhanced EpisodeData interface with screenplay fields
   - Added hasScreenplay and sceneCount metadata
   - Auto-loads full episode data including screenplay

4. `app/dashboard/projects/[id]/videos/new/page.tsx`
   - Added episodeData state storage
   - Passes episodeData to both StreamingRoundtableModal instances

5. `components/agents/streaming-roundtable-modal.tsx`
   - Added episodeData prop to interface
   - Passes episodeData to API endpoint

6. `app/api/agent/roundtable/stream/route.ts`
   - Accepts episodeData parameter
   - Builds screenplayContext string from episode data
   - Passes screenplay context to agent orchestrator

7. `lib/ai/agent-orchestrator-stream.ts`
   - Added screenplayContext to interface
   - Includes screenplay context in agent system prompts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Database (episodes table)
  ↓
API Endpoint (/api/episodes/[id]/full-data)
  ↓
EpisodeSelector Component
  ↓ (onEpisodeDataLoaded callback)
Video Creation Page (episodeData state)
  ↓ (episodeData prop)
StreamingRoundtableModal Component
  ↓ (API request body)
Agent Roundtable Stream API
  ↓ (screenplay context building)
Agent Orchestrator
  ↓ (system prompt injection)
AI Agents (GPT-4 with screenplay context)
```

### Screenplay Context Format

When episode data is available, the system generates:

```typescript
EPISODE SCREENPLAY CONTEXT:
Series: "Beyond The Stars" - Season 1, Episode 4: "Through the Static"
Logline: [episode logline]
Synopsis: [episode synopsis]

STRUCTURED SCREENPLAY (N scenes):

Scene 1: Location - Time Period
Description: [scene description]
Characters: [character list]
Dialogue: [dialogue count] exchanges
Actions: [action list]

... (up to 3 sample scenes)

IMPORTANT: This video is based on the above screenplay. Use the scene
descriptions, dialogue, actions, and character interactions to inform
your creative decisions.
```

### Component Architecture

**ScreenplayViewer Component**:
- **Props**: `open`, `onClose`, `episode`
- **State**: `expandedScenes` (Set of scene IDs)
- **Features**:
  - Expand All / Collapse All controls
  - Scene count badge
  - Conditional rendering for structured vs unstructured
  - Empty state with helpful message

**EpisodeSelector Enhancement**:
- **New Interface Fields**:
  - `hasScreenplay: boolean`
  - `sceneCount: number`
- **Data Processing**:
  - Generates detailed brief from episode data
  - Extracts screenplay metadata
  - Passes full context to parent

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Screenplay Context Truncation
**Decision**: Include first 3 scenes as examples, truncate text to 1000 chars
**Rationale**: Balance context richness with token limits for AI processing
**Location**: `app/api/agent/roundtable/stream/route.ts:158-174`

### 2. Modal vs Inline Display
**Decision**: Use modal dialog for screenplay viewing
**Rationale**: Keeps series page clean, provides focused reading experience
**Component**: `ScreenplayViewer` uses shadcn Dialog

### 3. Auto-Load vs Manual Selection
**Decision**: Auto-load episode data when episode selected
**Rationale**: Seamless UX, reduces user friction, ensures data availability
**Location**: `components/videos/episode-selector.tsx:138-185`

### 4. Structured vs Unstructured Support
**Decision**: Support both screenplay formats with fallback
**Rationale**: System evolution - some episodes have structured data, others text only
**Component**: `ScreenplayViewer` has conditional rendering logic

## Appendix: Code Snippets

### ScreenplayViewer Component Header
```typescript
export function ScreenplayViewer({ open, onClose, episode }: ScreenplayViewerProps) {
  const [expandedScenes, setExpandedScenes] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())

  const hasStructured = episode.structured_screenplay?.scenes &&
                        episode.structured_screenplay.scenes.length > 0
  const hasText = episode.screenplay_text &&
                  episode.screenplay_text.trim().length > 0
```

### Episode Data Auto-Load
```typescript
const handleEpisodeChange = async (episodeId: string | null) => {
  onEpisodeSelect(episodeId)
  if (!episodeId) {
    if (onEpisodeDataLoaded) {
      onEpisodeDataLoaded(null)
    }
    return
  }

  setLoadingData(true)
  try {
    const fullDataResponse = await fetch(`/api/episodes/${episodeId}/full-data`)
    const fullData = await fullDataResponse.json()

    const detailedBrief = generateDetailedBrief(fullData)
    const hasScreenplay = !!(fullData.episode.structured_screenplay?.scenes?.length > 0 ||
                             fullData.episode.screenplay_text)
    const sceneCount = fullData.episode.structured_screenplay?.scenes?.length || 0

    if (onEpisodeDataLoaded) {
      onEpisodeDataLoaded({
        ...fullData,
        brief: detailedBrief,
        hasScreenplay,
        sceneCount,
      })
    }
  } catch (err: any) {
    console.error('Failed to load episode data:', err)
    alert(err.message || 'Failed to load episode data')
  } finally {
    setLoadingData(false)
  }
}
```

### Screenplay Context Building
```typescript
if (episodeData && episodeData.episode) {
  const { episode, series } = episodeData
  const parts: string[] = []

  parts.push(`\n\nEPISODE SCREENPLAY CONTEXT:`)
  parts.push(`\nSeries: "${series.name}" - Season ${episode.season_number}, Episode ${episode.episode_number}: "${episode.title}"`)

  if (episode.logline) {
    parts.push(`\nLogline: ${episode.logline}`)
  }

  if (episode.structured_screenplay?.scenes && episode.structured_screenplay.scenes.length > 0) {
    parts.push(`\n\nSTRUCTURED SCREENPLAY (${episode.structured_screenplay.scenes.length} scenes):`)

    const scenesToInclude = episode.structured_screenplay.scenes.slice(0, 3)
    scenesToInclude.forEach((scene: any) => {
      parts.push(`\n\nScene ${scene.scene_number}: ${scene.location} - ${scene.time_of_day}`)
      parts.push(`Description: ${scene.description}`)
      // ... additional scene details
    })
  }

  screenplayContext = parts.join('')
}
```
