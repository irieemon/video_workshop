# AI Series Creator Integration

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: Integrated AI Series Creator into application with dual creation paths
**Status**: ✅ **Complete**

---

## Overview

The AI Series Creator (Concept Agent) is now fully integrated into the application, providing users with two options when creating a new series:

1. **AI-Assisted Creation**: Interactive dialogue with AI that generates comprehensive series concepts
2. **Manual Creation**: Traditional form-based series creation with optional project association

---

## User Flows

### From Project Context

**Location**: `/dashboard/projects/[id]/series`

**UI Elements**:
- **AI-Assisted Button**: Outline button with sparkle icon
- **New Series Button**: Primary button for manual creation

**Flow**:
```
Project Series Page
  ├─ Click "AI-Assisted"
  │  ├─ Navigate to `/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/series/concept`
  │  ├─ Interactive AI dialogue
  │  ├─ Generate comprehensive concept
  │  ├─ Review & create
  │  └─ Return to project with new series associated
  │
  └─ Click "New Series"
     ├─ Open CreateSeriesDialog modal
     ├─ Fill form (name, description, genre)
     ├─ Auto-associated with current project
     └─ Navigate to new series detail page
```

### From Standalone Context

**Location**: `/dashboard/series`

**UI Elements**:
- **AI-Assisted Button**: Outline button with sparkle icon (header)

## Implementation Details

### Pages Modified

#### 1. Standalone Series Page (`app/dashboard/series/page.tsx`)

**Header Section** (lines 91-101):
```tsx
<div className="flex gap-2">
  <Button variant="outline" asChild>
    <Link href="/dashboard/series/concept">
      <Sparkles className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
      AI-Assisted
    </Link>
  </Button>
  {(projects && projects.length > 0) && (
    <CreateSeriesDialog projects={projects} />
  )}
</div>
```

**Empty State** (lines 122-137):
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-2 justify-center">
  <Button
    size="sm"
    variant="outline"
    className="w-full sm:w-auto"
    asChild
  >
    <Link href="/dashboard/series/concept">
      <Sparkles className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
      AI-Assisted Creation
    </Link>
  </Button>
  {(projects && projects.length > 0) && (
    <CreateSeriesDialog projects={projects} />
  )}
</div>
```

**Changes**:
- Added `Sparkles` icon import
- Added AI-Assisted button to header (always visible)
- Added AI-Assisted button to empty state
- Removed "Go to Projects" button from empty state

#### 2. Project Series Page (`components/series/series-list.tsx`)

**Already Implemented** (no changes needed):
- AI-Assisted button in header
- AI-Assisted button in empty state
- Manual creation via CreateSeriesDialog

### Routes

| Route | Purpose | Context |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `/dashboard/series` | All series list | Standalone |
| `/dashboard/series/concept` | AI Series Creator | Standalone |
| `/dashboard/projects/[id]/series` | Project series list | Project |
| `/dashboard/projects/[id]/series/concept` | AI Series Creator | Project |

### Components

**ConceptAgentDialog**:
- Interactive AI dialogue for series creation
- Multi-turn conversation with specialized AI agent
- Generates structured YAML concept

**ConceptPreview**:
- Preview generated concept before persistence
- Shows characters, settings, relationships, episodes
- Accepts optional `projectId` for project association

**CreateSeriesDialog**:
- Manual series creation form
- Optional project selection for standalone context
- Auto-associates with project in project context

---

## UX Design Principles

### Consistent Visual Language

**AI-Assisted Elements**:
- Sparkle icon (✨) consistently indicates AI features
- Outline button style for secondary action
- "AI-Assisted" or "AI-Assisted Creation" label

**Manual Creation Elements**:
- Plus icon (+) for manual creation
- Primary button style (or shown alongside AI option)
- "New Series" or "Manual Creation" label

### Progressive Disclosure

**Empty State**:
- Shows both options prominently
- Explains benefits of series continuity
- No additional steps required to start creating

**With Existing Series**:
- Buttons in header for quick access
- Consistent placement across contexts
- Both options always available

### Context Awareness

**Project Context**:
- AI-created series auto-associates with project
- Manual creation auto-associates with project
- Return navigation goes to project view

**Standalone Context**:
- AI-created series can be standalone or associated
- Manual creation shows project selector
- Return navigation goes to series detail

## Feature Capabilities

### AI-Assisted Creation

**Dialogue Phases**:
1. **Core Concept**: Name, genre, premise, themes
2. **Character Development**: Protagonists, antagonists, supporting cast
3. **Setting Design**: Primary and secondary locations
4. **Episode Planning**: Season and episode structure

**Generated Content**:
- Complete series metadata (name, genre, logline, premise, tone, themes)
- Detailed character profiles (role, background, arc, motivation, voice)
- Rich setting descriptions (importance, atmosphere, first appearance)
- Character relationships (type, description, evolution notes)
- Episode concepts (titles, loglines, plot summaries, character focus)

**AI Quality Features**:
- Enum validation for database compliance
- Character name consistency across episodes
- Relationship type mapping
- Genre categorization
- Visual and voice profile integration

### Manual Creation

**Form Fields**:
- Series name (required)
- Description (optional)
- Genre selection (dropdown)
- Project association (optional in standalone)

**Workflow**:
1. Fill basic information
2. Create series shell
3. Add characters/settings/episodes manually later
4. Build incrementally over time

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

**AI-Assisted Path**:
```
User → ConceptAgentDialog → OpenAI API → YAML Generation →
Validation → ConceptPreview → Persist API → SeriesConceptPersister →
Database Insertion → Redirect
```

**Manual Path**:
```
User → CreateSeriesDialog → Form Submission → Series API →
Database Insertion → Redirect
```

### Persistence

**AI-Assisted**:
- Inserts series with `screenplay_data.seasons` for episode concepts
- Inserts all characters with visual fingerprints and voice profiles
- Inserts all settings with details
- Inserts character relationships with evolution notes
- Auto-generates `sora_prompt_template` for character consistency

**Manual**:
- Inserts series with basic metadata
- User adds characters/settings/episodes separately
- Incremental content development

### Project Association

**ConceptPreview** accepts `projectId` prop:
- From project context: `projectId` passed automatically
- From standalone context: `projectId` is `undefined`

**Redirect Logic**:
```tsx
if (projectId) {
  router.push(`/dashboard/projects/${projectId}`);
} else {
  router.push(`/dashboard/series/${data.seriesId}`);
}
```

5. Review in preview
6. Click "Create Series"
7. **Expected**: Return to project page, series visible with project association

#### Scenario 2: AI-Assisted from Standalone
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/series`
2. Click "AI-Assisted" button (header or empty state)
3. Complete dialogue with Concept Agent
4. Generate concept
5. Review in preview
6. Click "Create Series"
7. **Expected**: Navigate to series detail page, series created as standalone

#### Scenario 3: Manual from Project
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/projects/{id}/series`
2. Click "New Series" button
3. Fill form (name, description, genre)
4. Click "Create Series"
5. **Expected**: Navigate to series detail page, series associated with project

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Verify AI-created series
SELECT
  s.id,
  s.name,
  s.project_id,
  s.screenplay_data->'seasons' as episode_concepts,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sc.id) as character_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ss.id) as setting_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT cr.id) as relationship_count
FROM series s
LEFT JOIN series_characters sc ON s.id = sc.series_id
LEFT JOIN series_settings ss ON s.id = ss.series_id
LEFT JOIN character_relationships cr ON s.id = cr.series_id
WHERE s.user_id = '[user-id]'
GROUP BY s.id
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;
```

### Expected Results

**AI-Assisted Series**:
- ✅ Has `screenplay_data.seasons` with episode concepts
- ✅ Has characters with visual fingerprints
- ✅ Has settings with details
- ✅ Has character relationships
- ✅ `project_id` matches context (if created from project)

**Manual Series**:
- ✅ Has basic metadata only
- ✅ No characters/settings/episodes initially
- ✅ `project_id` matches selection
