## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Integration

**Series Detail Page Structure**:
```tsx
<SeriesDetailPage>
  {/* Header with back button and series info */}

  <EpisodeManager seriesId={seriesId} seriesName={seriesName} />
  <Separator />

  <SoraSettingsManager ... />
  <Separator />

  <CharacterManager ... />
  <Separator />

  {/* Other series components */}
</SeriesDetailPage>
```

**EpisodeManager Component Structure**:
```tsx
<EpisodeManager>
  {/* View Mode: 'list' */}
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>
      <Title>Episodes</Title>
      <Button>New Episode</Button>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
      <EpisodeList>
        {episodes.map(episode => (
          <EpisodeCard>
            <ActBreakdown />
            <StoryBeats />
            <Buttons>
              <Edit onClick={handleEditEpisode} />
              <Eye onClick={handleViewScenes} />
              <Delete onClick={handleDeleteEpisode} />
            </Buttons>
          </EpisodeCard>
        ))}
      </EpisodeList>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>

  {/* View Mode: 'scenes' */}
  {viewMode === 'scenes' && (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <BackButton onClick={handleBackToList} />
        <Title>Episode {n}: {title}</Title>
      </CardHeader>
      <SceneList episodeId={episodeId} />
    </Card>
  )}

  {/* Screenplay Chat Modal */}
  <ScreenplayChat open={chatOpen} ... />
</EpisodeManager>
```

### State Management

**Episode Manager State**:
```typescript
const [episodes, setEpisodes] = useState<Episode[]>([])
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
const [selectedEpisode, setSelectedEpisode] = useState<Episode | null>(null)
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'list' | 'detail' | 'scenes'>('list')
const [chatOpen, setChatOpen] = useState(false)
const [chatTarget, setChatTarget] = useState<{ type, id }>({ type: 'series' })
```

**View Mode Transitions**:
- `list` → Default view showing all episodes
- `detail` → Detailed episode view (currently unused, but available)
- `scenes` → Scene list for selected episode

### Navigation Handlers

```typescript
// Navigate to scenes view
const handleViewScenes = (episode: Episode) => {
  setSelectedEpisode(episode)
  setViewMode('scenes')
}

// Navigate back to episodes list
const handleBackToList = () => {
  setSelectedEpisode(null)
  setViewMode('list')
}
```
