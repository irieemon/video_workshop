## Test Failure Analysis

### Failure 1: `/api/agent/roundtable/advanced/route.test.ts`
**Status**: ❌ FAILING
**Reason**: Next.js 15 server component compatibility issues
**Error**: `Cannot find module 'next/server'` import error

**Root Cause**:
- Tests import Next.js server APIs that don't work in Jest environment
- Next.js 15 changed server component architecture
- Tests marked as `describe.skip` but still throw import errors

**Impact**: API route tests for AI agent roundtable completely broken

### Failure 2: `/api/videos/route.test.ts`
**Status**: ❌ FAILING
**Reason**: Similar Next.js 15 compatibility issues
**Impact**: Video CRUD API tests completely broken

---

## Critical Coverage Gaps

### Priority 1: AI Agent Systems (0% Coverage)
**Business Impact**: Core product functionality completely untested

**Untested Systems**:
1. **Agent Orchestration** (`agent-orchestrator.ts`, `agent-orchestrator-stream.ts`)
   - Multi-agent roundtable coordination
   - Streaming response handling
   - Agent synthesis logic
   - **Risk**: Silent AI response failures, incorrect prompt generation

2. **Screenplay Processing** (`screenplay-parser.ts`, `screenplay-agent.ts`)
   - Dialogue extraction (recently implemented)
   - Scene parsing
   - Character identification
   - **Risk**: Dialogue missing from prompts (was actual bug found recently)

3. **Prompt Generation** (`screenplay-to-prompt.ts`, `ultra-detailed-prompt-template.ts`)
   - Screenplay → Sora prompt transformation
   - Template application
   - **Risk**: Invalid prompts sent to Sora API

### Priority 2: API Routes (0% Coverage)
**Business Impact**: All backend endpoints untested

**Untested Endpoints**:
- `/api/agent/roundtable/*` - AI agent coordination
- `/api/videos/*` - Video CRUD
- `/api/projects/*` - Project management
- `/api/series/*` - Series management
- `/api/screenplay/*` - Screenplay operations
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication flows

**Risk**: API breaking changes undetected, data corruption, security vulnerabilities

### Priority 3: User-Facing Components (99% Untested)
**Business Impact**: UI bugs reach production unchecked

**Critical Untested Components**:
- Video editor interface
- AI agent roundtable UI
- Screenplay chat interface
- Episode/series management UI
- Project dashboard

**Risk**: Poor UX, broken user flows, React errors in production

### Priority 4: Security & Infrastructure (0% Coverage)
**Business Impact**: Security vulnerabilities undetected

**Untested Security Systems**:
- `middleware/admin-auth.ts` - Admin authorization
- `rate-limit/index.ts` - API rate limiting
- `supabase/middleware.ts` - Session management
- Authentication middleware

**Risk**: Unauthorized access, DoS attacks, session hijacking

## Test Quality Issues

### Issue 1: Intentionally Skipped Tests
**Files**: 4 test suites marked with `describe.skip` or `test.skip`

**Reason (from test comments)**:
> "API route tests are skipped due to Next.js 15 server component complexities. These would be better tested with E2E tests or integration tests with a test server"

**Analysis**: Tests were written but disabled rather than fixed. This creates false sense of test coverage.

### Issue 2: Mock-Heavy Tests
**Observation**: Tests that exist heavily rely on mocking Supabase, OpenAI, and Next.js APIs

**Risk**: Tests pass but real integrations fail. Mocks drift from actual behavior.

### Issue 3: No Integration Tests
**Gap**: No tests validate end-to-end flows across multiple systems

**Example Missing Tests**:
- User creates project → adds series → generates episode → creates prompt
- Screenplay parsing → dialogue extraction → agent orchestration → final prompt
- Authentication → session management → protected route access

## Comparison to Project Standards

### From `.claude/CLAUDE.md`:
> **Test Coverage Requirements**:
> - Unit Tests: All utility functions, hooks, and complex logic
> - Component Tests: User interactions and conditional rendering
> - Integration Tests: API routes and database operations
> - E2E Tests: Critical user flows

**Current Reality vs. Standards**:
- ❌ Utility functions: 9.2% vs. 100% required
- ❌ Component tests: <1% vs. comprehensive required
- ❌ API route tests: 0% (broken) vs. all routes required
- ⚠️ E2E tests: 2 files exist but coverage unknown

### From `jest.config.ts`:
**Coverage Threshold**: 5% (statements, lines, functions, branches)
**Current Coverage**: 1.94%
**Status**: ❌ NOT MEETING MINIMUM THRESHOLD

---

## Test Infrastructure

### Jest Configuration
```typescript
// jest.config.ts
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 5,
    functions: 5,
    lines: 5,
    statements: 5,
  },
}
```

**Analysis**: 5% threshold is extremely low (industry standard: 70-80%). Even this minimal threshold is not met.

### E2E Configuration
**Framework**: Playwright
**Files**: `e2e/video-creation.spec.ts`, `e2e/authentication.spec.ts`
**Status**: Tests exist but not analyzed (running separately from unit tests)

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Immediate Action Required)
1. **AI Agent Systems (0%)**: Core product functionality untested
   - **Likelihood**: High (active development, complex logic)
   - **Impact**: Critical (broken prompts, wrong AI responses)
   - **Recent Bug**: Dialogue not appearing in prompts (was actual production bug)

2. **API Routes (0%)**: All backend endpoints untested
   - **Likelihood**: High (frequent changes)
   - **Impact**: Critical (data loss, security issues)

3. **Authentication/Security (0%)**: No security layer testing
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (stable but critical)
   - **Impact**: Critical (unauthorized access, data breach)

### Medium Risk
4. **Component Library (99% untested)**: UI bugs reach users
   - **Likelihood**: High (active UI development)
   - **Impact**: Medium (poor UX, frustrated users)

5. **Data Parsing (0%)**: Screenplay parser, scene extraction
   - **Likelihood**: Medium (stable but complex)
   - **Impact**: High (incorrect data, broken workflows)

### Low Risk
6. **shadcn/ui Components**: UI primitives from library
   - **Likelihood**: Low (stable third-party)
   - **Impact**: Low (documented, community-tested)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

**1. Fix Failing Tests**
```bash
# Action: Update test setup for Next.js 15 compatibility
# Files: __tests__/app/api/**/*.test.ts
# Effort: 4-8 hours
# Impact: Restore API route test capability
```

**2. Unblock Skipped Tests**
```bash
# Action: Remove describe.skip, fix or delete obsolete tests
# Files: 4 skipped test suites
# Effort: 2-4 hours
# Impact: Get accurate coverage picture
```

**3. Test Critical AI Systems**
```bash
# Priority files to test:
# - lib/ai/agent-orchestrator-stream.ts
# - lib/utils/screenplay-parser.ts
# - lib/ai/screenplay-to-prompt.ts
# Effort: 16-24 hours
# Impact: Catch AI response bugs before production
```

### Short-term Actions (Month 1)

**4. API Route Integration Tests**

## Testing Best Practices (Not Currently Followed)

### From Project Docs
> **Feature Development Pattern**:
> 1. Write failing test
> 2. Implement feature
> 3. Verify test passes
> 4. Refactor if needed

**Current Reality**: Features developed without tests, tests added later (if at all)

### Recommended Pattern
```typescript
// 1. Write test first
describe('dialogue extraction', () => {
  it('extracts character dialogue from screenplay', () => {
    const screenplay = /* ... */
    const result = parseScreenplayText(screenplay)
    expect(result.scenes[0].dialogue).toEqual([
      { character: 'ORIN', lines: ['dialogue text'] }
    ])
  })
})

// 2. Implement feature (test fails initially)
export function parseScreenplayText(text: string) {
  // Implementation
}

// 3. Test passes
// 4. Refactor with confidence
```

## Conclusion

**Testing Coverage Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**

The project has **1.94% test coverage** against a minimum threshold of 5%, with **98% of the codebase completely untested**. This represents significant technical debt and business risk.

**Key Issues**:
1. Core AI functionality (agent orchestration, screenplay parsing) has zero tests
2. All API endpoints are untested (tests exist but are broken/skipped)
3. Recent production bug (missing dialogue) would have been caught with proper test coverage
4. Test infrastructure exists but is underutilized

**Recommendation**: Implement immediate testing sprint to reach 15% coverage within 2 weeks, focusing on AI systems and API routes. Establish "no new features without tests" policy going forward.

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/sc:implement "Fix failing Next.js 15 API route tests"` to restore test capability
2. Run `/sc:implement "Test critical AI systems"` to add agent orchestrator tests
3. Run `/sc:implement "API route integration tests"` to cover backend endpoints
4. Establish CI/CD coverage gates to prevent regression
