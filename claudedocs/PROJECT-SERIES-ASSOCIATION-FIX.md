# Project-Series Association Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Issue**: Series created via Concept Agent not associated with projects
**Status**: ✅ **Fixed**

---

## Problem

When creating a series via the Series Concept Agent from `/dashboard/series/concept`, the series was created as standalone (with `project_id = null`). When viewing a project's series page, it showed "No series yet" because it only queries series with that specific `project_id`.

**User Experience**:
- User in project view clicks "Create Series"
- Uses Concept Agent to generate complete series
- Returns to project view → "No series yet"
- Series exists but not associated with project

---

## Solution

### 1. Added `projectId` Support to Persistence Flow

**Updated Components**:
- `ConceptPreview`: Accepts optional `projectId` prop, passes to persist API
- `Persist API`: Accepts optional `projectId`, passes to persister
- `SeriesConceptPersister`: Uses `projectId` when inserting series

**Code Changes**:

```typescript
// components/series/concept-preview.tsx
interface ConceptPreviewProps {
  concept: SeriesConceptOutput;
  onBack: () => void;
  projectId?: string; // NEW
}

const response = await fetch('/api/series/concept/persist', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ concept, projectId }), // UPDATED
});

// Redirect appropriately
if (projectId) {
  router.push(`/dashboard/projects/${projectId}`);
} else {
  router.push(`/dashboard/series/${data.seriesId}`);
}
```

```typescript
// app/api/series/concept/persist/route.ts
interface PersistRequest {
  concept: SeriesConceptOutput;
  projectId?: string; // NEW
}

const { concept, projectId } = body;
const result = await persister.persistConcept(validation.data!, user.id, projectId);
```

```typescript
// lib/services/series-concept-persister.ts
async persistConcept(
  concept: SeriesConceptOutput,
  userId: string,
  projectId?: string // NEW
): Promise<{ success: boolean; seriesId?: string; error?: string }> {
  const { data: seriesData, error: seriesError } = await supabase
    .from('series')
    .insert({
      user_id: userId,
      project_id: projectId || null, // UPDATED
      name: concept.series.name,
      // ... rest of fields
    })
}
```

### 2. Created Project-Specific Concept Page

**New File**: `app/dashboard/projects/[id]/series/concept/page.tsx`

Same as standalone concept page but passes `projectId` to `ConceptPreview`:

```typescript
export default function ProjectSeriesConceptPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}) {
  const { id: projectId } = use(params);
  // ... concept agent dialog logic

  return (
    <ConceptPreview
      concept={generatedConcept}
      onBack={handleBackToDialogue}
      projectId={projectId} // Pass project ID
    />
  );
}
```

### 3. Added AI-Assisted Creation Button to Project Series List

**Updated**: `components/series/series-list.tsx`

Added button to launch Concept Agent with project context:

```tsx
<div className="flex gap-2">
  <Button variant="outline" asChild>
    <Link href={`/dashboard/projects/${projectId}/series/concept`}>
      <Sparkles className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
      AI-Assisted
    </Link>
  </Button>
  <Button onClick={() => setShowCreateDialog(true)}>
    <Plus className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
    New Series
  </Button>
</div>
```

Also updated empty state to show both options.

## User Flow

### Before Fix
```
Project View → Series Tab → "No series yet" → Create Series (manual form)
Standalone Series Creation → Series created without project association
```

### After Fix
```
Project View → Series Tab → "No series yet"
  ├─ Click "AI-Assisted" → Concept Agent
  │  └─ Generate & Create → Series associated with project ✅
  └─ Click "Manual Creation" → Manual form → Series associated with project ✅
```

---

## Testing

### Manual Test
1. Create or navigate to a project
2. Go to project's Series tab
3. Click "AI-Assisted" button
4. Complete dialogue with Concept Agent
5. Generate concept
6. Click "Create Series"
7. **Expected**: Return to project view with series displayed
8. **Verify**: Series has `project_id` set correctly

### Database Verification
```sql
SELECT
  s.id,
  s.name,
  s.project_id,
  p.name as project_name
FROM series s
LEFT JOIN projects p ON s.project_id = p.id
WHERE s.user_id = '[user-id]'
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;
```

Should show series with `project_id` populated.

## Architecture

### Series Association Patterns

**Standalone Series** (`project_id = null`):
- Created via `/dashboard/series/concept`
- Managed via `/dashboard/series`
- Independent of any project
- Redirect to `/dashboard/series/{seriesId}`

**Project-Associated Series** (`project_id = [uuid]`):
- Created via `/dashboard/projects/{id}/series/concept`
- Managed via `/dashboard/projects/{id}/series`
- Belongs to specific project
- Redirect to `/dashboard/projects/{id}`

**Flexibility**:
- Same persister logic handles both cases
- `projectId` parameter determines association
- Redirect logic based on presence of `projectId`

---

## Files Modified

**Updated**:
1. `components/series/concept-preview.tsx` - Added projectId prop and redirect logic
2. `app/api/series/concept/persist/route.ts` - Accept projectId parameter
3. `lib/services/series-concept-persister.ts` - Use projectId in series insert
4. `components/series/series-list.tsx` - Added AI-Assisted button

**Created**:
1. `app/dashboard/projects/[id]/series/concept/page.tsx` - Project-specific concept page

---

## Impact

### Fixed
✅ Series created via Concept Agent can be associated with projects
✅ Project series page shows series created through AI
✅ Clear UI for choosing AI-assisted vs manual creation
✅ Proper navigation after series creation

### User Experience
**Before**: Confusing - series created but not visible in project
**After**: Clear - two creation options, series immediately visible

### Future Enhancements
- Allow moving series between projects
- Bulk series creation for multiple projects
- Clone series across projects

---

**Status**: Complete and ready for testing
**Next**: Test end-to-end flow of creating series from project context
