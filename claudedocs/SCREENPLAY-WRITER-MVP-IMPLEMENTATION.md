## Database Schema

### New Tables Created

#### 1. **episodes** - Professional Episode Structure
```sql

- runtime_minutes, status, notes
```

#### 2. **scenes** - Individual Scenes â†’ Video Prompts
```sql
Fields:
- id, episode_id, scene_number
- scene_heading (INT/EXT. LOCATION - TIME)
- location, time_of_day, interior_exterior
- action_description, dialogue (JSONB), emotional_beat

- **Helper function**: `generate_scene_video_prompt(scene_id)` creates prompts from scene elements
- **View**: `episode_overview` shows episodes with scene counts and production status

## Screenplay Agent System

### Professional Expertise
The agent is configured with deep knowledge in:

**Story Structure**:
- Three-Act Structure (Setup â†’ Confrontation â†’ Resolution)
- Five-Act Structure (Classical dramatic structure)
- Hero's Journey (Campbell's monomyth)
- Save the Cat (Blake Snyder's beat sheet)

**Character Development**:
- Want vs. Need (external goal vs. internal growth)
- Fatal Flaw (character weakness)
- Character Arc (positive/negative/flat transformation)
- Backstory Wound (past event driving behavior)

**Scene Craft**:
- Scene Purpose (advance plot, reveal character)
- Scene Structure (Goal â†’ Conflict â†’ Disaster)
- Emotional Beats tracking
- Show Don't Tell principles

**Professional Format**:
- INT/EXT scene headings
- Action lines (present tense, visual)
- Proper dialogue formatting
- Page count guidelines (1 page = 1 min)

### Guided Discovery Process

The agent follows this systematic flow:

**Phase 1: Core Concept**
- Logline (protagonist + goal + obstacles)
- Genre and tone
- Target audience
- Unique selling point

**Phase 2: Protagonist Deep Dive**
- Who they are (background, defining trait)
- What they WANT (concrete external goal)
- What they NEED (internal growth required)
- Fatal flaw (what holds them back)
- Backstory wound (what drives behavior)

**Phase 3: Story Structure**
- Inciting incident (disrupts normal world)
- First plot point (point of no return)
- Midpoint revelation (false victory/defeat)
- Dark night of the soul (lowest point)
- Climax (final confrontation)
- Resolution (new equilibrium)

**Phase 4: Supporting Cast**
- Key characters and their roles
- Character relationships
- Relationship evolution

**Phase 5: Episode Planning**
- Total episode count
- Season/series arc
- Major episode beats
- A/B/C plot structure

**Phase 6: Scene Breakdown**
- Key scenes per act
- Scene purpose
- Character appearances
- Emotional progression

### Conversation Style
- **Socratic questioning**: Ask clarifying questions to understand vision
- **Professional terminology**: Use industry terms with clear explanations
- **Probe deeper**: Challenge surface-level answers
- **Teach while building**: Explain *why* choices matter
- **Adaptive expertise**: Detect user knowledge level and adjust

### Red Flags the Agent Catches
- Protagonist lacking clear want/need
- Weak or late inciting incident
- No real stakes or consequences
- Passive protagonist
- Unclear motivation
- Deus ex machina solutions
- Missing emotional logic

1. No disruption to current workflow
2. Screenplay writer appears as optional enhancement
3. Can add screenplay structure to existing series retroactively

### New Users
1. Can choose quick path (current) or screenplay path
2. Guided to screenplay writer for series with >3 episodes
3. Onboarding highlights screenplay benefits for serious creators

## Documentation Needed
