# Phase 2 Implementation Complete - Screenplay-to-Video Data Flow

## Summary

Phase 2 of the screenplay-to-video data flow has been successfully implemented. The system now allows users to convert individual scenes from episode screenplays directly into Sora video prompts with full context enrichment.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. API Endpoints

#### GET /api/episodes/[episodeId]/scenes
**File**: `app/api/episodes/[episodeId]/scenes/route.ts`

**Purpose**: Retrieves all scenes from an episode's structured screenplay

**Features**:
- Fetches structured screenplay data
- Returns scene summaries with metadata
- Includes dialogue preview for each scene
- User authentication and authorization
- Graceful handling when screenplay doesn't exist

**Response Format**:
```typescript
{
  episode: { id, title, season_number, episode_number },
  scenes: [
    {
      scene_id, scene_number, location,
      time_of_day, time_period, description,
      characters, hasDialogue, hasActions,
      duration_estimate, dialoguePreview
    }
  ],
  totalScenes: number
}
```

#### POST /api/episodes/[episodeId]/scenes/[sceneId]/convert-to-video
**File**: `app/api/episodes/[episodeId]/scenes/[sceneId]/convert-to-video/route.ts`

**Purpose**: Converts a specific scene into a video with full screenplay enrichment

**Features**:
- Extracts scene from episode's structured screenplay
- Gathers series context (characters, settings, visual style)
- Generates enriched Sora prompt with all context
- Creates video record with screenplay enrichment data
- Supports technical overrides and custom instructions
- Returns enrichment context for transparency

**Request Body**:
```typescript
{
  duration?: number
  customInstructions?: string
  technicalOverrides?: {
    aspectRatio, resolution, cameraStyle,
    lightingMood, colorPalette, overallTone
  }
}
```

**Response Format**:
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  video: { id, title, optimized_prompt, scene_id },
  enrichmentContext: {
    charactersIncluded, settingsUsed,
    dialogueExtracted, actionsExtracted,
    sceneInfo
  }
}
```

### 2. UI Component

#### EpisodeSceneSelector
**File**: `components/videos/episode-scene-selector.tsx`

**Purpose**: Interactive UI for browsing and converting episode scenes to videos

**Features**:
- Displays all scenes from an episode
- Shows scene metadata (location, time, characters)
- Previews dialogue from each scene
- Indicates which scenes have dialogue and actions
- One-click scene-to-video conversion
- Loading and error states
- Navigation to video editor after conversion
- Visual indicators for screenplay-enriched content

**UI Elements**:
- Scene cards with full context
- Character list display
- Dialogue previews (first 2 lines)
- Duration estimates
- Convert buttons with loading states
- "Screenplay-Enriched" badge

### 3. Service Layer (from Phase 1)

#### ScreenplayEnrichmentService
**File**: `lib/services/screenplay-enrichment.ts`

**Methods Used in Phase 2**:
- `extractScene()` - Gets scene from episode
- `getSeriesContext()` - Gathers related series data
- `generateEnrichedPrompt()` - Creates comprehensive Sora prompt
- `createEnrichmentData()` - Structures data for database

### 4. Database Schema (from Phase 1)

**New Columns in `videos` Table**:
- `scene_id` (TEXT) - Links video to screenplay scene
- `screenplay_enrichment_data` (JSONB) - Stores extracted context

**Indexes**:
- `idx_videos_scene_id` - Fast scene lookups
- `idx_videos_screenplay_enrichment` - JSONB queries

### 5. Documentation

#### SCREENPLAY-TO-VIDEO-USAGE.md
**File**: `claudedocs/SCREENPLAY-TO-VIDEO-USAGE.md`

- Complete usage guide
- API reference
- Before/after examples
- Integration instructions

## Example: Real-World Usage

### Input: Episode S1E3 "The Dividing Line", Scene 4

**Screenplay Content**:
```
Scene 4: Through the Static
Location: Cryo Bay interior (INT DAY)
Characters: Orin Kale, Sol

Description: Endless rows of translucent pods fading into mist.

Action: Orin walks between cryo pods, mist swirling around him.
Pauses at flickering diagnostics panel. Sol's light forms a
humanoid outline nearby.

Dialogue:
ORIN: (whispered) It's listening.
SOL: (soft modulation) I am... aware. What am I?
```

**Series Context**:
```
Characters:
- Orin Kale: Caucasian, late 30s, worn utility jacket,
  crossed-out Expansion symbol tattoo
- Sol: AI, shifting light patterns, androgynous voice

Settings:
- Cryo Bay: Ship's cryogenic storage, translucent pods,
  mist-filled, blue lighting

Visual Style:
- Camera: ARRI ALEXA 35, Cooke Anamorphic lenses
- Lighting: Flickering panels, pulsing cyan accents
- Color: Cool cyan with magenta roll-off
- Tone: Cold serenity with bioluminescent flickers
```

### Output: Enriched Sora Prompt

**Generated Prompt** (condensed):
```
**Series Context**: The Ardent Horizon drifts through dead space
as time fractures and consciousness awakens.

**Location**: Cryo Bay interior (INT DAY)

**Scene Description**: Endless rows of translucent pods fading
into mist. Dim starlight through viewport.

**Characters**:
- Orin Kale (Engineer): Caucasian, late 30s, cynical yet moral,
  crossed-out Expansion symbol tattoo visible on forearm. Wears
  worn utility jacket with grease stains.
- Sol (AI): Manifests as shifting light patterns, soft and
  inquisitive, androgynous voice with harmonic undertones.

**Actions**: Orin walks between cryo pods, mist swirling. Pauses
at flickering diagnostics panel. Sol's light forms humanoid outline.

**Dialogue**:
Orin: "It's listening." (whispered, with dread)
Sol: "I am... aware. What am I?" (soft, modulated tones)

**Visual Execution**: Orin moving slowly through mist with
deliberate pacing. Sol's light rippling across surfaces in sync
with voice. Reflections symbolizing duality.

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully implements the core screenplay-to-video conversion system. The foundation from Phase 1 combined with the API endpoints, UI component, and documentation in Phase 2 creates a complete, working feature that solves the original problem:

**Problem**: Technical prompts are great, but missing dialogue and context from screenplay. Sora has to improvise.

**Solution**: Screenplay data (dialogue, actions, character details, settings) now flows automatically into video prompts. Sora receives complete instructions based on actual screenplay content.

The feature is ready for real-world usage and testing!
